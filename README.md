# Geometric Decision-based Attack (GeoDA)

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of SparseFool algorithm described in [] (). GeoDA is a Black-box attack to generate adversarial example for image classifiers which is presented in the following paper:


## Requirements

To execute the code, please make sure that the following packages are installed:

- [Foolbox](https://foolbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/installation.html)
- [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/user/install.html)
- [PyTorch and Torchvision](https://pytorch.org/) (install with CUDA if available)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)



## Contents

### GeoDA.py

This function implements the GeoDA algorithm.

The parameters of the function are:

- `im`: image (tensor).
- `net`: neural network.
- `lb`: the lower bounds for the adversarial image values.
- `ub`: the upper bounds for the adversarial image values.
- `lambda_ `: the control parameter for going further into the classification region, by default = 3.
- `max_iter`: max number of iterations, by default = 50.





### utils.py

Includes general functions

### data/

Contains some examples for the demos.
